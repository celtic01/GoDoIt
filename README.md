# To-Do List Application

This is a simple command-line To-Do List application for managing tasks such as adding new tasks, deleting tasks, marking tasks as completed, and navigating through your task list. Tasks are stored in `todos.json` to ensure they persist across sessions.

## Features

- **Insert a new task**: Add new tasks to the to-do list.
- **Delete a task**: Remove tasks from the list.
- **Mark a task as completed**: Track your progress by marking tasks as done.
- **Navigate tasks**: Move up and down the task list using `j` and `k`.
- **Persistent storage**: Tasks are saved in `todos.json` and will persist when the application is restarted.

## How to Use

- **Insert a task**:  
  Press `i` and type your new task to add it to the list.
  
- **Delete a task**:  
  Press `d` to delete the currently selected task.

- **Mark a task as completed**:  
  Press `Enter` to mark the currently selected task as completed.

- **Navigate through tasks**:  
  - Press `j` to move down through the task list.
  - Press `k` to move up through the task list.

## Future Work

- **Deadline**: Add a feature to include deadlines for tasks.
- **Timestamp**: Record timestamps for when tasks are added and completed, for better tracking.

This basic task manager can be further enhanced with deadlines and timestamps to provide more detailed task management.
